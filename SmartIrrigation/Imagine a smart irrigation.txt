Imagine a smart irrigation system designed to efficiently manage water usage in an agricultural field. The system starts in an idle state, constantly monitoring soil moisture levels and weather forecasts. When the soil moisture level falls below a predefined threshold, the system transitions to a watering state, activating irrigation valves to water the crops. If the weather forecast predicts rain, the system delays irrigation to conserve water. Users can manually control the irrigation system, overriding automated processes, or set a schedule to water the crops at specific times. In the scheduled watering state, the system begins watering at the scheduled time and adjusts based on weather forecasts. An operator can put the system into maintenance mode for servicing, disabling all automated and manual watering events. The system ensures efficient water usage, prioritizes crop health, and adapts to environmental conditions, offering seamless servicing options without disrupting normal operations.
